# Love Running 

Love Running is a website for a Dublin based running community.

## Description

In this project, I've built a static website using plain HTML and CSS. It's the first walkthrough project in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3Ei7Hf6">Code Institute Software Development Program</a>. It consists of the main page with general information about running and the community, a photo gallery and a sign up form.

## Learnings

- Building a project with HTML and CSS from the ground up.
- Using the basics of GIT through the process.
- Making a website responsive using media queries.
